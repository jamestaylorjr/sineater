Osa-miR167d negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae
ABSTRACT
	 	 	
Endogenous rice micro RNAs (miRNAs) hold potential for the improvement of breeding efforts-- particularly in the case of disease resistance. Previously, we identified a series of miRNAs that influence resistance to  the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae by comparing the rice miRNA expression pattern between resistant  and susceptible cultivars after infection. We found that expression pattern of miR167d was significantly affected[1] by <SPECIES>. According to the previous study, miR167d belongs to a conserved miRNA family that is involved in plant growth and development. Nevertheless, the role of this miRNA in rice disease resistance has yet to be explored. Here, we show that miR167d acts as a negative regulator of rice immunity against <SPECIES> by repressing the expression of its target gene the host. Upon infection. the expression of miR167d in resistant cultivars was significantly less than in susceptible cultivars. Meanwhile, the overexpression of miR167d induced susceptibility to several rice blast strains and, accompanied the down-regulation of resistance gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational level. Those downregulated genes included auxin responsive factors (ARFs) and predicted resistance (R) proteins. By contrast, overexpression of a miR167d repressor mimic led to improved resistance to rice blast. Moreover, all the target genes of miR167d were significantly increased in  expression in both the transgenic  MIM167d (repressor mimic) lines and resistant cultivars. Together, our results demonstrate that miR167d works as a negative regulator of rice resistance against <SPECIES> by down regulating host genes. This discovery represents a  new target for both breeding and engineering miRNA-mediated host resistance to <SPECIES>.

Introduction
Rice (Oryza sative L.) is a staple food for more than half of the world population(Khush, 2005; Liu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014). Rice blast caused by the fungal pathogen <SPECIES> is one of the most destructive diseases in the rice production industry. The Rice and rice blast interaction has already become a model for the study of fungal plant disease systems (Liu and Wang, 2016). A thorough elucidation of the mechanisms of host resistance to rice blast will undoubtedly prove scientifically and economically invaluable. 

The past several decades of research have revealed the picture of an intricately coevolved plant-pathogen interaction.  One of the most well-characterized features of this interaction is the two-layered system of innate immunity  plants use to protect themselves from pathogenic microorganisms (Jones and Dangl, 2006), and rice is no exception to this paradigm. The first layer of the immunity is based on the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at the plasma membrane to trigger “pattern-triggered immunity” (PTI) (Liu et al., 2012a; Shimizu et al., 2010). In this layer, a series of defensive physiological responses occur such as  the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and the deposition of callose at the cell wall(Lam, 2004). Through PTI, plants can effectively prevent most potentially pathogenic microorganisms from making an incursion (Boller and Felix, 2009). However, most successful pathogenic microorganisms have evolved mechanisms to inhibit PTI, such as the intracellular secretion of effector proteins. In turn, plant hosts have  developed a  series of resistance (R) proteins which can recognize pathogenic effectors and trigger a second layer of defense called “effector triggered immunity” (ETI) (Boller and He, 2009; Dou and Zhou, 2012; Liu et al., 2014), This second layer of plant immunity is almost always accompanied by the hypersensitive response (HR) phenotype (Boller and Felix, 2009; Jones and Dangl, 2006). 

Over the past few decades, several lines of evidence have indicated that small RNA (sRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of plant defense responses against fungal pathogens (Katiyar-Agarwal and Jin, 2010). sRNAs are 20 – 30 nucleotide long non-coding RNAs, which are involved in regulation of gene expression through a process termed RNA silencing. RNA silencing can occur either pre-transcriptionally through DNA methylation or chromatin modification, or post-transcriptionally by mRNA cleavage or translation inhibition (Baulcombe, 2004; Holoch and Moazed, 2015; Jones-Rhoades et al., 2006). Based on their origin and function, plant sRNAs can be classified into two major classes: small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNAs (miRNA). Most miRNA are 21-24 nucleotides long and are derived from RNAs which once contained a  paired hairpin secondary structure (Chen, 2009). By contrast, siRNAs are derived from complementary long dsRNAs (Xie et al., 2004). In planta, both Dicer-like proteins (DCLs), HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1) andHYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1) participate with the Serrate (SE) family of proteins  in the biogenesis of sRNA (Holoch and Moazed, 2015; Katiyar-Agarwal and Jin, 2010; Rogers and Chen, 2013). After processing, double stranded sRNA are sorted and loaded into Argonaute proteins(Liu and Paroo, 2010). This forms the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) (Baumberger and Baulcombe, 2005; Rogers and Chen, 2013). siRNA and miRNA are involved in the  response to both abiotic and biotic stresses, andregulate of variety biological process including growth, development, and reproduction (Chen, 2012; Katiyar-Agarwal and Jin, 2010; Khraiwesh et al., 2012). Presently, more than 38,000 miRNAs are included in the miRNA online database “miRBase” (http://www.mirbase.org/index.shtml).
      The first resistance related miRNA to be discovered in plants was Ath-miR393. This miRNA can induced by the PAMP  flg22, and it functions to enhance host resistance to virulent Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 by silencing auxin receptors and thereby suppressing auxin signaling (Navarro et al., 2006). Subsequently, studies indicated that miR393 in rice is a stress related miRNA, which is broadly involved in abiotic and biotic stresses (Bian et al., 2012; Campo et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2012). Another 16 miRNAs, including miR160a are induced by flg22 treatment. By contrast, a distinct set of 11 miRNAs, including miR398b and miR773, are down regulated by flg22 treatment (Li et al., 2010a). Overexpression of both miR773 and miR398b was demonstrated to suppress the induction of callose deposition by flg22 or bacteria treatment (Li et al., 2010a). 
      With regard to bacterial pathogens, an interesting study found that miR863-3p can target both positive and negative regulators of immunity  by fine tuning the amplitude and timing of their expression. miR863-3p negatively regulated an atypical receptor-like pseudokinase1 (ARLPK1) called ARLPK2 and SE at the early and late infection timepoints, respectively (Niu et al., 2016). miRNAs not only contribute to PTI, but they also contribute to ETI by regulating the plant defense-related genes and even through the direct regulation of R genes. For example, SNC1  was up regulated in ago1 and dcl4 mutants[2] (Yi and Richards, 2007). Further, while the expression of miR482 is up regulated by Pst DC3000,  the Pst DC3000 hrcc- mutant failed to induce this upregulation (Shivaprasad et al., 2012), indicating that intracellular effectors likely influence this miRNA’s expression. It was later revealed that the various targets of miR482 in cotton exceeds 10% of R genes. However, when infected by the fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae, miR482 was significantly downregulated leading to a corresponding upregulation of its target R genes (Zhu et al., 2013). Error!

      Several miRNAs have been implicated in the interaction between rice and <SPECIES>. For example, the host miRNAs miR528 and miR1879 were downregulated when treated with rice blast, leading to the upregulation of  oxidative stress genes (Baldrich et al., 2015). Similarly, miR393b and miR156 were both downregulated by rice blast treatment (Campo et al., 2013). In addition, miR7695 worked as a susceptibility factor  against rice blast through the downregulation of Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 6 (Nramp6) (Campo et al., 2013). Very recently it was revealed that miR169 works as a negative regulator against the blast fungal <SPECIES> by repressing the expression of its target genes  in the NF-YA family (Li et al., 2017). 
Two miRNAs, miR166k/miR166h, belong to miR166 family which functions as a positive regulator agains[3]t <SPECIES> (Salvador-Guirao et al., 2018). In the previous study, we identified exceed 30 miRNAs that regulate rice immunity to <SPECIES> (Li et al., 2014). In this group miRNAs, miR167d showed significant differences in accumulation in resistant cultivars relative to susceptible cultivars infected by <SPECIES>. Therefore, further investigations into the possible immune regulatory roles of miR167d  are clearly warranted.      
      Based on the sequence analysis the miR167 sequence and phylogenetic relationships assay, the result indicated that all the miR167-5p [4]don’t show variation. But, the miR167-3p was opposite, shows higher variabilit[5]y(De-la-Peña et al., 2017). Previously, overexpression of miR167 in Arabidopsis was demonstrated to inhibit somatic embryogenesis (SE)  by reducing the expression of auxin response factor 6 (ARF6) and ARF8  (Su et al., 2016). ARF6 and ARF8 are both miR167 targets which regulate adventitious root development in Arabidopsis. By contrast, ARF17 is a target of miR160, and acts as a negative regulator of adventitious root formation in Arabidopsis (Gutierrez et al., 2009; Gutierrez et al., 2012). Meanwhile, ARF6 and ARF8 also regulate gynoecium and stamen maturation, and promote jasmonic acid (JA) production. In the arf6 arf8 double mutant, there is an abnormal floral development phenotype and several development-related genes are reduced in expression (Nagpal et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2006). MiR167 is also involved in the normal growth and development of rice, and overexpression of miR167 in rice resulted in a reduced tiller number and plant shorter in height, moreover, ARFs act as its target genes also decrease in mRNA levels(Liu et al., 2012b).

To investigate the role of miR167d in rice immunity against <SPECIES> we examined the expression pattern in the susceptible cultivar  LTH and the resistant cultivar IRBLkm-Ts by inoculating both with the <SPECIES> strain Guy11. Next, we obtained  transgenic rice lines overexpressing miR167d and its target mimic (MIM167d).  After examining the expression of the target genes of miR167d in transgenic lines and in both the susceptible and resistant cultivars . We predicted that the target ARFs and candidate R genes might act as positive regulators in rice immunity. Taken together, we provide new evidence to suggest that rice miR167d promotes susceptibility to <SPECIES>.

Materials and methods 
Plant materials and growth conditions
The plants used in this research include: a susceptible line (LTH) and a resistant monogenic line (IRBLkm-Ts). The indica accession Kasalath was used for genetic transformation, and the transgenic lines overexpressing miR167d and its mimic (miR167d) were also in the Kasalath background. All these lines were planted in an climate controlled growth chamber at 26? and 80% humidity with a 12 hours light/dark cycle. The Nicotiana benthamiana were grown at 22? and 80% humidity under a 12 hour light/dark cycle in a climate controlled growth chamber im preparation for agrobacterium-mediated transient expression .

Construction of overexpressing transgenic plants
To generate transgenic plants overexpressing the miRNAs of interest the following procedures were followed. The genomic sequences from 470 bp upstream to 529bp downstream of osa-miR167d were amplified from Kasalath (KAS) total genomic DNA with primers miR167d-kpn1-F and miR167d-spe1-R (Supplementary Table 1), and the PCR products were cloned into the binary vector 35S-pCAMBIA1300 at KpnI and SalI sites, generating the overexpression construct, designated p35S:miR167d. To generate target mimicry transgenic plants, we utilized the gene IPS1 (INDUCED BY PHOSPHATE STARVATION1) in Arabidopsis as a skeletal structure. This gene contains a mismatched loop at the miR399 cleavage site, and therefore the target mimic sequence of miR167d was inserted into the IPS1 gene to substitute the miR399 target site with primers IPS1-KpnI-F, IPS1-SpeI-R, MIM167d-IPS1-BamHI/Bgl?-F and MIM167d-IPS1-BamHI/Bgl?-R by overlapping PCR (Supplementary Table 1), and cloned into the 35S-pCAMBIA1300 vector at the KpnI and SalI site, generating in the mimicry construct, designated p35S:MIM167d. Both of these constructs were transformed into the Kasalath background via Agrobacterium strain GV3101 mediated transformation, and all the transgenic plants were screened  by hygromycin resistance using a solution containing 0.1 mM 6-BA and 30 mg/L hygromycin as previously described (Li et al., 2014). Finally, we obtained 23 overexpression lines of p35S:miR167d (named OX167d) and 15 mimicry lines of p35S:MIM167d (named MIM167d). In order to confirm that miR167d represses the target gene as expected, we expressed the target sequence from the target gene tagged by eYFP. The target sequence of Os4g57610 was obtained using the gene specific primers (Supplementary Table S1). We also designed a mutant sequence based on the target sequence to act as a control. All the fragments were fused to N-terminus of eYFP and inserted into the KpnI site of the binary vector pCAMBIA1300. Additionally, the Agrobacterium strain GV3101 was used to perform transient expression assays in <SPECIES>(Huang et al., 2014).  

Pathogen infection and microscopy analysis
In this study, we used four <SPECIES> strains, Zhong8-10-14(GFP), Guy11, NC-10 and NC-34. To make spores, each <SPECIES> strain was grown at 28? in complete medium under  a 12 hour light/dark cycle. After two weeks, spores were collected adjusted to a concentration of  5*105 spores/ml for spray inoculation and punch inoculation on juvenile rice (3 leaf stage). The T3 generation seedlings of miR167d and MIM167d transgenic lines were used for spray inoculation. At the fifth day after inoculation, the relative fungal biomass was measured using using the DNA amount of Pot2 in <SPECIES> relative to the rice ubiquitin DNA amount measured by qRT-PCR. Foliar disease phenotypes were recorded, and the wild type Kasalath lines were used as control. For punch inoculation, leaves from 3 weeks old transgenic plants were slightly punched with tips and before 5 µL of spore suspension (5*105 spores per ml) was dropped onto the wound. Disease spot progression was recorded at 5dpi. In order to observe the infection process of rice blast, a GFP tagged <SPECIES> strain Zhong8-10-14 spores suspension was injected into the leaf sheaths as described previously (Li et al., 2017). Subsequently, the leaf sheaths were placed in petri dishes to retain moisture and excised for microscopy and analysis by Zeiss fluorescence microscope  (Zeiss imager A2) at 2, 12, 24, 36, 48 hpi, respectively. 
 
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR assay and JA measure
Juvenile rice seedlings at the three leaf stage were sprayed with the <SPECIES> spore suspension spore suspension (5*105 spores per ml). Water was used as a mock in this spray inoculation. Samples were collected at 0, 12, 24, 48 hpi, and Kasalath acted as a control for miR167d and MIM167d transgenic plants. For target gene expression level examination, Kasalath was also used as a wild-type control. Total plant RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) kits. cDNA was produced using ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (TOYOBO). To test the miRNA level of miR167d, we used the miScript Plant RT Kit and the miScript SYBR® Green PCR Kit (Invitrogen) based on the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was carried out using specific primers (Supplementary Table 1 ) and QuantiTect SYBR® Green PCR Kits (Invitrogen). snRNA U6 used as internal reference for detection of the miR167d level. All data was analyzed by a one-way ANOVA. To detect the JA content, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were carried out as previously reported (Liao et al., 2018; Teng et al., 2006).  

Agrobacterium mediated transient expression analysis
The expression plasmids were transferred to Agrobacterium strain GV3101, then incubated on  solid LB media containing kanamycin (50 µg/mL) and/or rifampicin (50 µg/mL)  at 28? for two days. Single colonies were transferred to liquid LB media also containing the corresponding antibiotics and incubated at 28°C overnight.Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000rpm for 5 min and re-suspended in a solution containing 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, and 100 µM acetosyringone. The Agrobacterium containing the expression plasmid were injected into <SPECIES>leaves for transient expression analysis. The injected leaves were examined at 48 hpi using confocal microscopy (Nikon A1) as previously reported (Huang et al., 2014). Simultaneously, a western blot assay was performed as previously described (Li et al., 2017). Briefly, protein from 100 mg fresh leaves was extracted  in extraction buffer containing 0.25 M Tris-HCL (pH6.8), 4% SDS, 0.1% Bromophenol blue, and 40% glycerol. The total protein was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) using Trans-Blot Turbo (BIO-RAD). eYFP was detected using polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (1:2000, BBI Life Science) and ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate system (BIO-RAD).

Results
MiR167d is differentially accumulated in susceptible line LTH and a resistant monogenic line IRBLkm-Ts 
To determine whether miR167d was differentially expressed after infection <SPECIES>, we performed qRT-PCR  to examine the expression pattern in the susceptible line LTH and the resistant monogenic line IRBLkm-Ts containing the R gene Pi-km and relative resistance to <SPECIES> (Tsunematsu et al., 2000; Zhi-Xue et al., 2017). LTH was used as a susceptible reference because no major R gene for <SPECIES> has been identified in LTH and highly susceptible to rice blast (Tsunematsu et al., 2000). We confirmed the resistance phenotypes in LTH and IRBLkm-Ts by inoculating the <SPECIES> strain Guy11 on the seedling of three leaves. [6]LTH showed a highly susceptible phenotype, but IRBLkm-Ts appeared  more resistant ; only a few small lesions were found (Figure 1A). The results of our miR167d expression time course indicated that in LTH, miR167d was reduced in expression at the 12 and 24 hpi timepoints, but it was elevated at 48 hpi.. However, miR167d was reduced in expression at 12, 24 and 48 hpi in IRBLkm-Ts (Figure 1B). These data indicate that miR167d may act as a negative regulator in rice against rice blast.

Overexpressing miR167d results in Enhanced Susceptibility to <SPECIES>
As miR167d expression was influenced by <SPECIES> infection,  the role of miR167d in rice against rice blast is an important question. Some of the target genes of miR167d are ARFs  and as ARFs regulate  growth and development  through auxin signalling, we hypothesized that auxin may play a role in rice immunity to <SPECIES>. To test this, we constructed rice transgenic plants that overexpress miR167d in the Kasalath background. We identified two independent lines with elevated miR167d accumulation, and these were used for resistance analysis (Figure 2C). Juvenile rice plants at the three leaf stage were used and separately sprayed with three different <SPECIES> strains with different virulence[7]. While NC-34 and NC-10 are the high pathogenicity strains on Kasalath, Guy11 is less virulent strain to Kasalath.  As expected, the overexpression lines showed more and larger disease lesions compared with the control plants infected with NC-34  using two different methods (punch and spray inoculation) (Figure 2A). More fungal biomass was also accumulated in miR167d overexpression lines (Figure 2B). This indicates  that miR167d overexpression may promote susceptibility to <SPECIES> NC-10 and Guy11 were also observed to cause greater disease severity in the overexpression lines than wild-type as measured by lesion production and fungal biomass.. This indicates that miR167d overexpression may promote susceptibility to <SPECIES>.

Overexpressing miR167d leads to Reduced Defense Responses
To investigate why overexpression of miR167d results in susceptibility, we examined the expression levels of typical defense-related and cell death related genes. Further, we performed microscopic to analysis to observe the infection process of <SPECIES> in the overexpression line relative to wild-type. qRT-PCR expression analysis revealed that the defense and cell death related genes KS4, PAL, NAC4, PR1a, PBZ1 and PR10b are typically expressed with two discernable patterns in wild-type controls.Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. First, KS4, PBZ1, and NAC4 aresignificantly induced in the control plants at 24 and 48 h after  <SPECIES> inoculation (Figure 3). Second, PAL, PR1a, PR10b showed elevated expression levels at 12, 24 and 48 hpi. However, in the miR167d overexpression line, all of these genes were lower at the corresponding time points, although these genes were also induced at some time points[8].  We also measured the basal level of JA in these plants, and our results indicate that JA accumulation was higher in the wild-type control (Figure S2A). These results suggest that a possible underlying cause of susceptibility to <SPECIES> in the miR167d overexpression lines was that the expression and accumulation, respectively, of several defense related genes and JA, were compromised.

Observations of the <SPECIES> infection process were carried out using the  Zhong8-10-14 strain tagged with GFP. At the 6 and 12 hpi, there were no significant differences in the hyphal invasiveness of the pathogen between wild and transgenic plants (Figure 4). However, at 24 hpi, more than 90% of the spores on the miR167d overexpression lines germinated invasive hyphae and infected the proximal cells (Figure 4B). By contrast,only 70% invasive hyphae were formed in the wild-type plants (Figure 4B).At 36 and 48 hpi, the hyphae invaded more cells in transgenic plants relative to the controls(Figure 4). These data indicate that overexpression miR167d can promote the <SPECIES> invasion and compromise the defence response in rice.
 
MiR167d negative regulates the Expression of Target Genes at Both Transcriptional and Translational Levels
Previously, the target genes of miR167d were identified by degradome sequencing (Li et al., 2010b; Wu et al., 2009).  We conjectured that the mRNA level of the miR167d target genes should be reduced in the miR167d overexpression lines.. As expected, the mRNA level of 6 target genes, including Os02g06910 (OsARF6), Os07g29820 (NBS-LRR disease resistance protein), Os07g33790 (glutamate receptor 3.4 precursor), Os12g41950 (OsARF25), Os04g57610 (OsARF12), and Os06g46410 (OsARF17), were significantly repressed in the overexpression lines, and Os06g03830 (retinol dehydrogenase) was repressed in one line, but not significantly repressed in the other line (Figure 5A). We also examined the protein level of Os04g57610 using a YFP-based reporter system. We germinated a construct that expressed the target site of miR167d in OsARF12 with YFP. Next, ARF12-YFP was co-expressed with miR167d in <SPECIES> 48 h after injection, we examined fluorescence intensity and the protein level. 
      Both the protein level and the fluorescence intensity TSOsARF12-YFP fusion were observed to be inversely proportional to the concentration of Agrobacterium containing miR167d  (Figure 5B-C).  However, miR167d didn’t reduce the intensity of the YFP control (MTS-OsARF12-YFP) (Figure 5B, C). In order to further confirm the inhibition by miR167d on TSOsARF12-YFP and whether MIM167d could compete with miR167d , we coexpressed TSOsARF12-YFP with both miR167d and MIM167d. ,Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.  This co expression resulted in stronger fluorescence intensity and protein level followingthe increasing concentration of Agrobacterium containing MIM167d (Figure 5B, D), but there was no effect on  MTSOsARF12-YFP. Together, these results indicate that miR167d can suppress TSOsARF12-YFP, but that MIM167d can prevent that suppression.

Overexpressing the target mimic of miR167d results in enhanced resistance to <SPECIES>
In order to further investigate the role of miR167d in rice blast immunity, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing MIM167d.  We predicted that overexpression MIM167d would lead to the downregulation of miR167d transcription and the commensurate upregulation of its target genes.
	First, we examined the expression level of miR167d in the transgenic MIM167d plants. As expected, miR167d was significantly reduced in  MIM167d plants (Figure 6A). Next, we examined the target gene expression of miR167d and found the expression level of all the target genes was significantly upregulated in two transgenic plants which contained the MIM167d construct (Figure 6B). Finally, we tested the resistance of the transgenic plants against the <SPECIES> strains NC-34, NC10, and Guy11 using  both spray and punch inoculation. Indeed, the number of lesions spots and the fungal biomass decreased significantly on the leaves from the transgenic plants compare with the control with all three <SPECIES> strains. (Figure 7A-D). Taken together, these results suggest that miR167d causes susceptibility  to rice blast.

Overexpressing target mimicry of miR167d leads to enhanced Defense Responses
 We examined the expression level of  rice defense genes in MIM176d transgenic plants, and also used microscopic techniques to observe the infection process of <SPECIES>.. As expected, all of these genes were significantly up regulated after infection  by NC-34 at 12, 24 and 48 hpi (Figure 8). Peak expression occurred at either 24 or 48 hpi. The expression of these genes was between 2 and 100 fold higher in the transgenic lines relative to wild-type. Another noteworthy observation was that all the measured defense genes exhibited higher constitutive in the MIM167d plants compare with wild type. Meanwhile, we measured the basal level of JA  and found the JA level to be lower in wild-type plants (Figure S2B).Furthermore, at 12 hpi, the number of appressoria formed by Zhong8-10-14 on MIM167d overexpression lines was ten percent less than in wild type (Figure 9). At 24 hpi, infection the first cell of <SPECIES> was forty percent higher in the control plant (Figure 9). At the 36 hpi, <SPECIES> had already penetrated three cells deep into the leaf sheaths of the wild-type plants (Figure 9). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that miR167d negative regulates t rice immunity against <SPECIES>.

The target genes of miR167 are differentially expressed in the susceptible line LTH and a resistant monogenic line IRBLkm-Ts 
We examined the expression level of miR167d target genes in LTH and IRBLkm-Ts at several time points after rice blast inoculation.. Os12g41950 expression was increased in TTH after <SPECIES> infection at 12 and 24 hpi, but increased in the IRBLkm-Ts at 48 hpi (Figure 10). The remaining six genes, Os04g57610, Os06g03830, Os02g06910, Os07g29820, Os07g33790 and Os06g46410, were all increased expression in both lines.  However the expression level was measurably higher in IRBLkm-Ts relative to LTH (Figure 10). Therefore, all of these  miR167d target genes are variably expressed upon <SPECIES> infection, and may play diverse roles in rice immunity against rice blast. All of the target genes are likely to contribute the resistance against rice blast. 

Discussion
Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. Here, we provide evidence that miR167d  acts as a negative regulator of immunity to  <SPECIES> in rice through the transcriptional modulation of its target genes. Our expression analysis revealed that the reduction of miR167d might be a defense response in rice against <SPECIES>.  Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. There is good reason to hypothesize ARFs in rice controlled by miR167d are indirectly involved in  JA signaling. In addition, all of these ARF genes had a higher mRNA level in the IRBLkm-Ts than LTH (Figure 10) and were reduced in expression in the miR167d overexpression lines (Figure 5A) Overexpression of miR167d in Kasalath  produced susceptibility as measured by foliar lesions (Figure 2 and Figure S1), and the defense related genes were downregulated following inoculation by <SPECIES> (Figure 3).he <SPECIES> invasion process also appeared to be accelerated in the overexpression line compare with the wild-type (Figure 4). 
      As expected, all the target genes of miR167d were downregulated in the transgenic lines (Figure 5A). Further, the  overexpression the target mimic of miR167d, in transgenic plants showed enhanced resistance against rice blast when measured by both disease phenotype and resistance gene expression (Figure 7, 8, and S3).(F the <SPECIES> invasion process was retarded in the transgenic plant (Figure 9). At the same time, the target genes were upregulated compare with the control plants (Figure 6B). 

Evidence suggests that miR167d  belongs to an ancient miRNA family that is conserved in many higher plants and regulates several developmental functions. In this study, we revealed that miR167d involved in the defense response against  <SPECIES> in rice, and demonstrated that miR167d can act as a negative regulator of immunity to this pathogen. This research may lead to improvements in the ongoing efforts to improve rice resistance through breeding methods by selecting for miR167d accumulation.

increase/decrease?
in response to what? You should be more specific here
I'm not sure what this means. Positive regulator against rice blast infection or positive regulator for the infection of rice blast?
Unclear what you mean here. Try rewriting this sentence
variability within species? Within the miRNA family?
this might belong in the methods section?
The words virulence and pathogencity are very specific terms. They both have important meaning. Be careful to say what you mean here.
