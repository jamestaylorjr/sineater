Osa-miR167d negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae
ABSTRACT
Studying the role of rice endogenous miRNA that involved in rice and rice blast interaction is of a great significance for rice breeding and disease control. In the previous study, we identified a series of miRNAs that participate in resistance to rice blast by comparing the rice miRNA expression pattern between resistant material and sensitive material after infected Magnaporthe oryzae. We found that expression pattern of miR167d was greatly affected by <SPECIES>. According to the previous study, miR167d is belong to a conserved microRNA (miRNA) family that involved in plant growth and develop. Nevertheless, the role of miR167d in rice immunity is still unknown. Here, we show that miR167d acts as a negative regulator in rice and rice blast interaction and repress rice immunity against the rice blast by repressed its target gene expression. The expression of miR167d was significantly suppress in a resistant material, meanwhile, overexpression miR167d became more susceptible to different rice blast strains and accompanied down-regulation expression of resistance genes. Including its target genes, auxin responsive factors (ARFs) and predicted resistance (R) protein gene were also reduced expression by overexpression of miR167d at transcriptional and translational level. In contrary, overexpression its target mimicry that act as a repressor of miR167d led to more resistance to rice blast. Moreover, all the target gene of miR167d were differently higher expression in the transgenic lines of MIM167d and resistant material. Taken together, our result demonstrate that miR167d worked as a negatively regulator in rice immunity against <SPECIES> by differently down regulate its target genes. This discovery provide the potential for engineer breeding by miRNA.

Introduction
Rice (Oryza sative L.) is one of the staple food grain for more than half of the population in the word (Khush, 2005; Liu et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014). Rice blast is one of destructive disease for rice production that caused by the fungal pathogen <SPECIES>. As in the following, rice and rice blast interaction has already become a model for plant disease system in study of plant and fungi interaction (Liu and Wang, 2016). Well study on the resistance mechanism to this disease has a great significance on underpin the disease control and economically.

During the plant and pathogen coevolution and the research in the past few decades, it well known that plant mount a two-layered innate immunity system to protect themselves avoid the damage by the pathogenic microorganism (Jones and Dangl, 2006), not except the rice. The first layer of the immunity is based on recognize the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and named PAMP- triggered immunity (PTI) (Liu et al., 2012a; Shimizu et al., 2010). In this layer, a series of defensive reactions will happen, like active oxygen burst and callose deposition(Lam, 2004), plant can effectively prevent most of pathogenic microorganism from make an incursion(Boller and Felix, 2009). However, successful pathogenic microorganisms can deliver the evolved effectors into plant cells and inhibit PTI. In turn, host also developed another system that can recognize the effectors of pathogen by resistance (R) proteins (Boller and He, 2009; Dou and Zhou, 2012; Liu et al., 2014), this is a second layer of plant immunity and called effector triggered immunity (ETI), accompanied by hypersensitive responses (HR)(Boller and Felix, 2009; Jones and Dangl, 2006). 

During the past few decades the increasing results showed that small RNA (sRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of defense response in plants among plant and fungal interaction(Katiyar-Agarwal and Jin, 2010). SRNAs are a type of 20 – 30 nucleotide long and non-coding RNAs, which involved in regulation of gene expression through a process termed RNA silencing. RNA silencing either by DNA methylation or chromatin modification or by mRNA cleavage or translation inhibition (Baulcombe, 2004; Holoch and Moazed, 2015; Jones-Rhoades et al., 2006). Based on the origin and function, plant sRNAs can be classified into major classes: small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). Most miRNA are belong to 21- 24 nucleotide length and derived from RNA that have a base paired hairpin structures(Chen, 2009), however siRNA are derived from complementary long dsRNA(Xie et al., 2004). In planta, both Dicer-like proteins (DCLs), HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1), HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1) and Serrate (SE) are participated in the biogenesis pathways of sRNA(Holoch and Moazed, 2015; Katiyar-Agarwal and Jin, 2010; Rogers and Chen, 2013). After process, double stranded sRNA are sorted and loaded into Argonaute proteins, then the passenger strand is drop-off(Liu and Paroo, 2010), then form RNA induced silencing complex (RISC)(Baumberger and Baulcombe, 2005; Rogers and Chen, 2013). Both of the siRNA and miRNA are involution in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses and in regulation of variety biological process include growth and development, reproduction (Chen, 2012; Katiyar-Agarwal and Jin, 2010; Khraiwesh et al., 2012). Up to now, more than 38000 miRNAs are included in miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org/index.shtml). The first discovered resistance related miRNA in plant is Ath-miR393. This miRNA can induced by the pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecule flg22 and enhance the resistance to virulent <SPECIES> DC3000 by silence the F-box auxin receptors and thus suppressing the auxin signaling(Navarro et al., 2006). Future study indicated that miR393 in rice is a stress related miRNA, which widely involved in abiotic and pathogens stresses (Bian et al., 2012; Campo et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2012). Other 16 miRNAs, including miR160a are induced by flg22 treatment. In contrast, other 11 miRNAs, including miR398b and miR773 are down regulated by flg22 treatment(Li et al., 2010a). Overexpression of miR773 and miR398b were suppressed the callose deposition by flg22 or bacteria treatment(Li et al., 2010a). In bacterial defending, an interesting studying about miR863-3p is that the miRNA can target both immunity positive regulator and negative regulator by fun turning on amplitude and timing. The miR863-3p negatively regulated a typical receptor-like pseudokinase1 (ARLPK1), ARLPK2 and SE gene at the early infection and later infection, respectively(Niu et al., 2016). MiRNAs are not only contribute to PTI, but also contribute to ETI by regulating the plant defense relative resistance genes and directly regulating R genes. For example, SNC1 as a R genes was up regulated in ago1 and dcl4 mutants(Yi and Richards, 2007). The expression of miR482 is up regulated by Pst DC3000 but failed by Pst DC3000 hrcc-(Shivaprasad et al., 2012), future study revealed that miR482 in cotton target exceed 10% of R genes, when infected by pathogen <SPECIES>, miR482 was down regulated and R genes were up regulate in cotto n(Zhu et al., 2013). In Arabidopsis, miR472 involved in both PTI and ETI by targets RPS5 R genes(Boccara et al., 2014).    

Amount of miRNAs were involved in <SPECIES> and rice iteraction. MiR528 and miR1879 were down regulated when treatment with rice blast, and lead to up regulation of control oxidative stress genes (Baldrich et al., 2015). Alike miR393b and miR156, both of them were down regulated by rice blast treatment(Campo et al., 2013). In addition, miR7695 worked as a positive regulator against rice blast though down regulate Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 6 (Nramp6)(Campo et al., 2013). The latest study identi?ed that miR169 work as a negative regulator against the blast fungal <SPECIES> by repressing expression of its target genes that belong to the NF-YA family (Li et al., 2017). MiR166k/miR166h, belong to miR166 family that functions as a positive regulator against <SPECIES>(Salvador-Guirao et al., 2018). In the previous study, we identified exceed 30 miRNAs that involute in rice immunity of that against <SPECIES> (Li et al., 2014). In this group miRNAs, miR167d was greatly differently accumulated in resistant materials and sensitive materials after infected <SPECIES>. Hence, it is very significative to investigate the role of miR167d of that against <SPECIES>, because whether miR167d is involved in rice resistance to rice blast is remain unknown.

Based on the analysis the miR167 sequence and phylogenetic relationships assay, the result indicted that all the miR167-5p don’t show variation. But, the miR167-3p was opposite, shows higher variability(De-la-Peña et al., 2017). Based on the previously study, Overexpression of miR167 in Arabidopsis led to inhibited somatic embryo (SE) formation by reducing the auxin response factor 6 (ARF6) and ARF8 expression(Su et al., 2016). ARF6 and ARF8 are the target of miR167 that regulate Arabidopsis adventitious rooting. Whereas, ARF17 is a target of miR160 and acts as a negative regulator.(Gutierrez et al., 2009; Gutierrez et al., 2012). Meanwhile, ARF6 and ARF8 also regulate gynoecium and stamen maturation, and promote jasmonic acid (JA) production. In the arf6 and arf8 double mutants, the flowers are abnormal growth and numbers of development-related genes reduce expression (Nagpal et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2006). MiR167 also involved in the normal growth and development of rice, overexpressing miR167 in rice resulted in a reduced tiller number and plant shorter in height, moreover, ARFs act as its target genes also decrease in mRNA levels(Liu et al., 2012b).

To investigate the role of miR167d in rice immunity against <SPECIES>. First, we examined the expression pattern in susceptible material LTH and the resistant material IRBLkm-Ts by inoculate <SPECIES> strain Guy11. Then, we obtained the overexpressing transgenic rice lines of miR167d and its target mimicry (MIM167d), following by exam the miR167d target genes expression in transgenic lines and in susceptible/resistant materials. We predicted that the ARFs and candidate R gene might act as a positive regulators in rice immunity. Taken together, we provide a new evidence that rice miR167d is a negative regulator for rice immunity against the <SPECIES>.

Materials and methods 
Plant materials and growth conditions
All the plants used in this research include: a susceptible line LTH and a resistant monogenic line IRBLkm-Ts, the indica accession Kasalath was used for genetic transformation, and the transgenic lines overexpressing miR167d and mimicry of miR167d ware also in the background of Kasalath. All these rice plants were planted in an artificial climate chamber at 26? and 80% humidity under the 12 hours light and 12 hours dark conditions. The Nicotiana benthamiana were grown at 22? and 80% humidity under the 12 hours light and 12 hours dark conditions in an artificial climate chamber, prepared for agrobacterium-mediated transient expression .

Construction of overexpressing transgenic plants
To generate over-expression transgenic plants, genomic sequences from 470 bp upstream to 529bp downstream of osa-miR167d was amplified from Kasalath (KAS) total genomic DNA with primers miR167d-kpn1-F and miR167d-spe1-R (Supplementary Table 1), and the PCR products was cloned into the binary vector 35S-pCAMBIA1300 at KpnI and SalI sites, generating in the overexpression construct, named p35S:miR167d. To generate target mimicry transgenic plants, we utilized the gene IPS1 (INDUCED BY PHOSPHATE STARVATION1) in Arabidopsis that as a skeletal structure, this gene contains a mismatched loop at the miR399 cleavage site. Therefore, target mimicry sequence of miR167d was inserted into IPS1 gene to substitute the miR399 target site with primers IPS1-KpnI-F, IPS1-SpeI-R, MIM167d-IPS1-BamHI/Bgl?-F and MIM167d-IPS1-BamHI/Bgl?-R by overlap PCR (Supplementary Table 1), and cloned into the 35S-pCAMBIA1300 vector at the KpnI and SalI site, generating in the mimicry construct, named p35S:MIM167d. Both of these two construct were transformed into Kasalath background via Agrobacterium strain GV3101 mediated transformation and all the transgenic plants were screened by the solution contained 0.1 mM 6-BA and 30 mg/L hygromycin as previously described(Li et al., 2014). Finally, we obtained 23 overexpression lines of p35S:miR167d (named OX167d) and 15 mimicry lines of p35S:MIM167d (named MIM167d). In order to confirm that the miR167d repress the target gene, we expressed the target sequence from the target gene tagged by eYFP, the target sequence of Os4g57610 was obtained using the gene specific primers (Supplementary Table S1), we also designed a mutant sequence based on the target sequence and acted as a control. All the fragments were fused to N-terminus of eYFP and inserted into Kpn? site of binary vector Pcambia1300. Then Agrobacterium strain GV3101 was used as a transient expression assay in <SPECIES>(Huang et al., 2014).  

Pathogen infection and microscopy analysis
In this study, we used four <SPECIES> strains, Zhong8-10-14(GFP), Guy11, NC-10 and NC-34. All these <SPECIES> stains were put at 28? in complete medium under the 12 h light and 12 h dark condition for make spores. After two weeks, collected the spores and adjusted the concentration to 5*105 spores per ml for spray inoculation and punch inoculation on the seeding with three leaves. T3 generation seeding of miR167d and MIM167d transgenic lines were used for spray inoculation, at the fifth day after inoculation, the relative fungal biomass was detected using the DNA level of Pot2 in <SPECIES> compare with the rice ubiquitin DNA level by qRT-PCR and the disease phenotypes were recorded on the leaves, meanwhile wild type plant Kasalath were used as control. For punch inoculation, leaves from 3 weeks old transgenic plants were slightly punched with tips and dropped 5 µL spore suspension (5*105 spores per ml) to the wound. Disease spot was recorded at 5dpi. In order to observe the infection process of the rice blast, GFP tagged <SPECIES> strain Zhong8-10-14 was used, injected the spore suspension to the leaf sheaths as described previously(Li et al., 2017), put the leaf sheaths in the petri dish and keep high moisture, then excised the leaf sheaths from the inoculated leaf sheaths and analyzed by Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Zeiss imager A2) at 2, 12, 24, 36, 48 hpi, respectively. 
 
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR assay and JA measure
The seeding with three leaves were sprayed with the <SPECIES> spore suspensions (5*105 spores per ml) and sprayed the H2O as mock, then collected the samples at 0, 12, 24, 48 hpi, Kasalath act as a control for miR167d and MIM167d transgenic plants. For target gene expression level examination, Kasalath also used as a control. Total plants RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) from the samples, flowing by reverse first strain cDNA using ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (TOYOBO). To test the miRNA level of miR167d, using miScript Plant RT Kit and miScript SYBR® Green PCR Kit (Invitrogen) and based on the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was carried out using specific primers (Supplementary Table 1 ) and QuantiTect SYBR® Green PCR Kits (Invitrogen), snRNA U6 used as internal reference for detection miR167d level. All this dates are determined by a one-way ANOVA. To detect the JA content, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out as previously reported (Liao et al., 2018; Teng et al., 2006).  

Agrobacterium mediated transient expression analysis
The expression plasmids were transferred to Agrobacterium strain GV3101, then incubated on the sold LB media contained kanamycin (50 µg/mL), rifampin (50 µg/mL) and  at 28? for two days, selected monoclonal colony to liquid LB media also contained the corresponding antibiotics and incubated at 28?for overnight, collected the bacteria using the centrifuge at 4000rpm for 5 min and re-suspended in a solution containing 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MES, 100 µM acetosyringone. The Agrobacteria contain the expression plasmid were injected into <SPECIES> leaves for transient expression analysis. The injection leaves were examined at 48 hpi using the confocal microscope (Nikon A1) as previously reported(Huang et al., 2014), meanwhile, the samples were collected at the same time and western blot assay was performed as previously described(Li et al., 2017), in brief, 100 mg fresh leaves were used for extracting total protein in extraction buffer containing 0.25 M Tris-HCL (pH6.8), 4% SDS, 0.1% Bromophenol blue, 40% glycerol, then the total protein was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore) using Trans-Blot Turbo (BIO-RAD), then using polyclonal anti-GFP (1:2000, BBI Life Science) and ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate system (BIO-RAD) to detect eYFP level.

Results
MiR167d is differentially accumulated in susceptible line LTH and a resistant monogenic line IRBLkm-Ts 
To determine whether miR167d is differentially expression after infected <SPECIES>, we preformed the qRT-PCR assay to examine the expression pattern in susceptible line LTH and a resistant monogenic line IRBLkm-Ts that contains the R gene Pi-km and high resistance to <SPECIES>(Tsunematsu et al., 2000; Zhi-Xue et al., 2017). LTH was used as a susceptible reference, because no major R gene for <SPECIES> has been identified in LTH and highly susceptible to rice blast(Tsunematsu et al., 2000). Firstly, we confirmed the resistance phenotypes in LTH and IRBLkm-Ts by inoculating the <SPECIES> strain Guy11 on the seeding of three leaves. LTH showed a highly susceptible phenotype, but IRBLkm-Ts was more resistance and only few small lesions were found (Figure 1A). Then followed by time course assay to check the expression of miR167d in LTH and IRBLkm-Ts by using qRT-PCR. The result showed that miR167d was reduced expression at the 12 and 24 hpi, higher at 48 hpi in LTH. However, miR167d was reduced expression at 12, 24 and 48 hpi in IRBLkm-Ts (Figure 1B). These data indicated that miR167d may act as a negative regulator in rice against rice blast.

Overexpressing miR167d results in Enhanced Susceptibility to <SPECIES>
As miR167d was effected by <SPECIES>, thus it is response to study the integrative role of miR167d in rice against rice blast. Although some of the target genes of miR167d belongs to ARFs family, and in the previous research, ARFs effected the growth and develop of plant, maybe AUXIN also have the relevant to rice immunity. In this station, we constructed the rice transgenic plants that overexpression miR167d in the Kasalath background. Finally, we identified two independent lines that have a high miR167d accumulation and used for resistance analysis (Figure 2C). The seeding with three leaves were used and separately spray with three different <SPECIES> strains with the different virulent. While NC-34 and NC-10 are the high pathogenicity strains to Kasalath, Guy11 is a little weak virulent strains to Kasalath. The disease phenotypes were collected at 5 days after inoculate. As our respected, the overexpression lines showed more and larger disease lesion compare with the control plants by using NC-34 <SPECIES> strain with two different methods (Figure 2A), it indicating that more susceptibility by overexpression the miR167d. Where after, the fungal growth were performed by quantitative analysis. Then the fungal growth was higher compare with control plants (Figure 2B). After that, we used another method to detected the resistant, as showed in Figure 2D and E, the lesion is bigger and fungal growth was higher compare with the control plant by using the paunch menthes. Then we check another <SPECIES> strains Guy11 and NC-10. As the same result, when inoculated with NC-10 in was showed more susceptible phenotype (Figure S1A), and the fungal growth was higher than control plant (Figure S1A). We got the same result that inoculated the Guy11 (Figure S1C, D). These date demonstrate that overexpressing miR167d led the susceptibility to the <SPECIES> in Kasalath. 

Overexpressing miR167d leads to Reduced Defense Responses
To investigate why overexpression of the miR167d result in more susceptibility, we examined expression levels of some typical defense related genes, and cell death related genes, and also used the microscopic to analysis the infection process of <SPECIES>. Firstly, seedlings with three leaves were used to examine the defense related genes by qRT-PCR, including KS4, PAL, NAC4, PR1a, PBZ1 and PR10b. KS4 takes part in the phytoalexins momilactones A and B biosynthesis, NAC4 is involved in plant cell death and higher expression in spl11 at the lesion forming period(Yin et al., 2000), and it also act as a basal defense gene which can be earlier induced (Park et al., 2012). PBZ1, PR1a and PR10b were pathogenesis genes (Shirsekar et al., 2014). PAL is involved in phenylpropanoid pathway and PAL pathway is important for SA biosynthesis(Chen et al., 2009). The expression patterns of these genes can be divided into two categories: KS4, PBZ1 and NAC4 were significantly induced in the control plants at 24 and 48 h after inoculated <SPECIES> (Figure 3). However, PAL, PR1a, PR10b were increased along with the 12, 24 and 48 hpi. To the contrary, in the transgenic plants which overexpression miR167d, all of these genes were lower at the corresponding time points, although these genes were also induced at some time points. At the same time, we measured the basal level of JA in the seeding with three leaves, it indicted that JA level is higher in the wildtype plant (Figure S2A).      These results show that the <SPECIES> related genes and JA were compromised in the overexpression of miR167d transgenic plants.

Furthermore, we conducted the infection process assay of <SPECIES> strain Zhong8-10-14 tagged by GFP on the leaf sheath of the control and miR167d overexpression transgenic plants by Zeiss fluorescence microscope. At the 6 and 12 hpi, there were no significant difference between wild and transgenic plants (Figure 4). At 24 hpi, more than 90% spores generated the invasive hyphae and infected the first infected cell (Figure 4B). But only 70% invasive hyphae were formed in the wild plants (Figure 4B). As time goes on, at 36 and 48 hpi, the hyphae invaded more cells in transgenic plant compare with the control plants (Figure 4). These date show that overexpression miR167d can promote the <SPECIES> invasion and compromise the deference response in rice.
 
MiR167d negative regulates the Expression of Target Genes at Both Transcriptional and Translational Levels
In the previous study, the target genes of miR167d has been identified by degradome sequencing (Li et al., 2010b; Wu et al., 2009). They are encoded the Auxin response factor (ARFs), Retinol dehydrogenase 14, Glutamate receptor 3.4 precursor and NBS-LRR disease resistance protein, respectively. As we know, the role of miRNA is to suppress its target genes by transcriptional and translational level. So we conjectured that the mRNA level of the target genes should be down expressed in the miR167d overexpression lines. For this purpose, we examined the expression level of the target genes in the miR167d overexpression plants. As our expected, the mRNA level of 6 target genes, including Os02g06910 (OsARF6), Os07g29820 (NBS-LRR disease resistance protein), Os07g33790 (glutamate receptor 3.4 precursor), Os12g41950 (OsARF25), Os04g57610 (OsARF12), Os06g46410 (OsARF17), were significantly repressed in the overexpression lines, and the Os06g03830 (retinol dehydrogenase) was repressed in one line, but not significantly repressed in the other line (Figure 5A). We also examined the protein level of Os04g57610 by a Yellow Fluorescent protein (YFP) based reporter system. We germinated a construct that expressing the target site of miR167d in the Os04g57610 with YFP. Next, TargetOs04g57610-YFP was expressed along or co-expressed with miR167d in <SPECIES>, then we examined the fluorescence intensity by the microscope at 48 h after injection, at the same time, the protein level was compared by western blotting assay. As our expected, the fluorescence intensity became weaker and weaker follow by the increasing concentration of agrobacterium contain miR167d in the target site of Os04g57610 with YFP (TSOs04g57610-YFP) (Figure 5B). It was the same result the protein level (Figure 5C). On the contrary, miR167d didn’t affect the intensity of YFP control (MTSOs04g57610-YFP) (Figure 5B, C). In order to further conform the inhibition by miR167d on TSOs04g57610-YFP and whether the MIM167d works, the MIM167d is a mimicry of miR167d, which could trap miR167d just like a sponge, there are three nucleotides insertion at the position 10 and 11 of miR167d, and generate a loop at the mismatched site, so it could inhibited the function of mi167d (Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007). When TSOs04g57610-YFP, miR167d and MIM167d were coexpressed, the fluorescence intensity became stronger and stronger and the got the same result in the protein level follow by the increasing concentration of agrobacterium contain MIM167d (Figure 5B, D), but there was no effect on the MTSOs04g57610-YFP, all of these indicated that miR167d could suppress the TSOs04g57610-YFP, but MIM167d could recover that. These date show that miR167d could repress the expression of Os04g57610, and MIM167d could repress the miR167d and works very well.    

Overexpressing target mimicry of miR167d results in Enhanced resistance to <SPECIES>
In order to further investigate the role of the immunity against rice blast caused by miR167d in rice, we generated transgenic plants that overexpression MIM167d. Because in the overexpression miR167d transgenic plants, the expression level of miR167d was significantly up regulate and its target genes were significantly repressed, and result in enhanced susceptibility to rice blast. Based on these reach dates, we predicted that overexpression MIM167d will lead to down regular the expression level of miR167d and up regulate its target genes. Firstly, we examined the expression level of miR167d in the transgenic plant of MIM167d, as our expected, miR167d was significantly reduced in the MIM167d plants (Figure 6A). Following by, we examined the target gene of miR167d, we get the same result, the expression level of all the target genes were significantly up regular in two transgenic plants which contain the MIM167d construct (Figure 6B). Then, we tested the resistance of the transgenic plants against <SPECIES> strains NC-34 using the seeding with three leaves by spray and paunch methods, respectively. Indeed, the number of lesions spots and the fungal biomass decreased significantly on the leaves from the transgenic plants compare with the control (Figure 7A, B). And we got the same result by paunch method, the lesions area and fungal biomass were also reduced significantly in the transgenic plants (Figure 7C, D). At the same time, we also examined the resistance against another two <SPECIES> strain, as our expected, we got then same result, MIM167d plants revealed enhance resistance against NC-10 and Guy11, and the lesions area and fungal biomass were significantly reduced on the leaves from MIM167d plants. According these datas, up regulator the target genes of miR167d enhanced the resistance against rice blast. Taken together, miR167d negative regular rice immunity against rice blast, or its target genes, or some of them, positively regular rice immunity.

Overexpressing target mimicry of miR167d leads to enhanced Defense Responses
Based on the result, we are inquisitive whether the defense related genes and cell death related genes will up regular in the MIM167d transgenic plants. Thus, we examined expression levels of some typical pathogen relative genes, and also used the microscopic to analysis the infection process of <SPECIES>. Firstly, seedlings with three leaves were used to examine the defense related genes by qRT-PCR, including KS4, PAL, NAC4, PR1a, PBZ1 and PR10b. As our expected, all of these genes were significantly up regular after induced by NC-34 at 12, 24 and 48 hpi (Figure 8). And the expression level reached the highest point at 24 or 48 hpi. And the expression level was on a few times or even hundred times in the transgenic plants compare with wild plants. Another noteworthy point is that all the pathogen relative genes expression higher at the background level in the MIM167d plants compare with wild type. Meanwhile, we measured the basal level of JA in the seeding with three leaves, it indicted that JA level is lower in the wildtype plant (Figure S2B).      

Furthermore, we conducted the infection process assay of <SPECIES> strain Zhong8-10-14 tagged by GFP on the leaf sheath of the control and MIM167d overexpression transgenic plants by Zeiss fluorescence microscope. At the 12 hpi, the formed appressoria was more ten percent less than wild type (Figure 9). At 24 hpi, infection the first cell of <SPECIES> was forty percent higher in the control plant (Figure 9). At the 36 hpi, <SPECIES> was already infected three cells in wild plant (Figure 9). Taken together, these date confirmed that miR167d negative regulator the immunity in rice against the <SPECIES>, whereas, according to its target genes, or some of them, positivity regulate the immunity in rice.

The Target Genes of miR167 are Differentially Expressed in susceptible line LTH and a resistant monogenic line IRBLkm-Ts 
Based on the research we have got, all the target genes of miR167d which already detected can be different inhibited by miR167d at transcriptional, and its can be recovered the target mimicry of miR167d. It is worth to address whether all of the target genes involved in regulated rice immunity against rice blast. In order to conform this hypothesis, we examined the expression level in LTH and IRBLkm-Ts at a time course upon rice blast inoculation. Based on the expression pattern, all the target genes divided into two groups. The first group included one genes, Os12g41950, the expression level of it was increased in TTH after <SPECIES> infection at 12 and 24 hpi, but increased in the IRBLkm-Ts at 48 hpi (Figure 10). The second group include six genes, Os04g57610, Os06g03830, Os02g06910, Os07g29820, Os07g33790 and Os06g46410, all of them were increased expression both LTH and IRBLkm-Ts, however, the expression level were higher in IRBLkm-Ts compare with that in LTH (Figure 10). Therefore, all of these target genes of miR167d are varying degrees expressed upon <SPECIES> infection and may act different roles in rice immunity against rice blast. All of the target genes are likely to contribute the resistance against rice blast in the IRBLkm-Ts.  

Discussion
The miR167d is conserved and has 10 family members in rice, based on the difference in the nucleotide sequence, the miR167d family can classify into two types (Figure S4), the first group is miR167a/b/c, and the other group is miR167d/e/f/g/h/i/j. the big difference between these two groups are that the last nucleotide site is different in the mature miR167. Predicted target genes of miR167 family were the same. Based on the previous reach by degradome sequencing, there were seven target genes of miR167, among of them, there are four ARFs genes (Os04g57610, Os02g06910, Os06g46410, Os12g41950)(Li et al., 2010b), and all of these genes are involved in the auxin signal pathway. They reserves a high homology at the nucleotide and amino acids sequences by luster method and phylogenetic tree method assay. Other target genes, Os06g03830 encode a retinol dehydrogenase 14, Os07g33790 encode a glutamate receptor 3.4 precursor. Os07g29820 encode a NBS-LRR disease resistance protein. In the previous research, miR167 family down regulate its target genes by cleavage the mRNA of target genes, especially the ARFs, which a required for growth and development, regulated the female and male reproduction, flower maturation, and jasmonic acid biosynthesis (Gutierrez et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2006). Except the roles of miR167 in the plant growth and development, the function of miR167 in the rice immunity against rice blast is still largely unknown. Here, we provide an evidence that miR167d in rice acts as a negative regulator in immunity against <SPECIES> through its target genes.

In our research, according to the qRT-PCR assay indicated that miR167d was significantly down regulate in the IRBLkm-Ts by inoculating Guy11 since 12 hpi, until to 48 hpi (Figure 1B). However, in the susceptible line LTH, the expression level of miR167d was first decreased and then increased (Figure 1B). At the same time, the target genes of miR16d had a higher expression level in the IRBLkm-Ts compare with LTH (Figure 10). In addition, IRBLkm-Ts developed no visible disease pots, but LTH revealed enhance disease pots on the leaves (Figure 1A). So, reduction of miR167d might be a defense response in rice against the <SPECIES>.  
  
Based on the previous study that miR167d could target for AFRs genes and all the miR167d regulated ARF genes are involved in the auxin signaling and plant growth and development in rice (Liu et al., 2012b). In Arabidopsis, ARF6 and ARF8 are the targets of miR167, they were involved in the auxin signaling and Arabidopsis adventitious root formation. ARF6 and ARF8 act as a positive regulators and positive control the expression of GH3.3, GH3.5, and GH3.6, result in an increase in JA conjugation, and reduction the free JA (Gutierrez et al., 2012). However, ARF6 and ARF8 act as a positive regulators of JA biosynthesis at the flower development stage (Nagpal et al., 2005; Tabata et al., 2010). There are reasons to believe that ARFs in rice controlled by miR167d are indirect involved in the JA signaling. In addition, all of these ARF genes had a higher mRNA level in the IRBLkm-Ts than LTH (Figure 10) and down expression in the miR167d overexpression lines (Figure 5A), when overexpression the target mimicry of miR167d, the ARFs were expression higher than wild type plants (Figure 6B). At the same time, Os07g29820 could encode an R protein, and it had the same expression pattern compare with ARFs. Overexpression miR167d in Kasalath showed more diseases phenotypes on the leaves (Figure 2 and Figure S1), and the defense related genes were down expression by inoculate the <SPECIES> strain (Figure 3), also the <SPECIES> invasion process was accelerated compare with the wild type (Figure 4). And all the target genes of miR167d were down expression in the transgenic line (Figure 5A). Last, when overexpression the target mimicry of miR167d, the transgenic plants showed enhance deference response against rice blast, including the disease phenotype was reduced (Figure 7 and Figure S3), and the defense related genes were up regulate (Figure 8), the <SPECIES> invasion process was reduced in the transgenic plant (Figure 9). At the same time, the target genes were up regulate compare with the control plants (Figure 6B). Hence, the miR167d act as a negatively regulator in rice immunity against rice blast by its target genes.

The miR167d is belong to an ancient miR167 family that is conserved in many higher plants with multitudinous developmental functions. According to the current study, we reveal that miR167d involved in the defense response against the <SPECIES> in rice, and showed that miR167d act as a negative regulator. This reach may led to resistance breeding of rice via managing miR167d accumulation, and it is possible to result in developing broad spectrum disease resistance in future.

The target sequence of Os4g57610 combine with eYFP act as a reporter constructs and the mutant on the target sequence of Os4g57610 act as a control, all of them were transiently expressed respectively or coexpressed with miR167d overexpression construct (C) or/and the miR167d target mimicry MIM167d construct (D) in <SPECIES> leaves by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression at the specified optical density concentration. 100 mg fresh leaves that injected Agrobacterium were collected and performed Western blot assay using anti-GFP. Rubisco was stained by ponceau and indicated the equal loading. The alignments of miR167d and Os4g57610 target sequence (C) and MIM167d with miR167d (D) were following the images respectively. Size bars = 100?m, TS= target sequence, MTS=mutant target sequence. Same results were obtained in three independent experiments.

Figure 6. Overexpression of miR167d target mimicry leaded to its target genes expression higher, but lower of miR167d level. 
Total RNA was extracted from positive transgenic plants, and qRT-PCR assay was used to detect the expression level of miR167d (A) and the expression level of its target genes (B). All the mRNA level was normalized to control plants. Error bars indicate SD (n=3). One-way ANOVA analysis was performed to determine the signi?cance of differences between each time course and the asterisks upon the error bars indicate signi?cant differences (P, 0.01). The experiments were repeated more than two times with similar results.
